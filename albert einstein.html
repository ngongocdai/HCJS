    <h1>Albert Einstein</h1>
    <p>
        lbert Einstein was born at Ulm, in Württemberg, Germany,
        on March 14, 1879. Six weeks later the family moved to Munich,
        where he later on began his schooling at the Luitpold Gymnasium.
        Later, they moved to Italy and Albert continued his education at Aarau,
        Switzerland and in 1896 he entered the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich
        to be trained as a teacher in physics and mathematics. In 1901, the year he gained his diploma,
        he acquired Swiss citizenship and, as he was unable to find a teaching post, he accepted a
        position as technical assistant in the Swiss Patent Office. In 1905 he obtained his doctor’s
        degree.
    </p>
    <p>
        During his stay at the Patent Office,
        and in his spare time, he produced much of his remarkable work
        and in 1908 he was appointed Privatdozent in Berne. In 1909 he
        became Professor Extraordinary at Zurich, in 1911 Professor of
        Theoretical Physics at Prague, returning to Zurich in the following year
        to fill a similar post. In 1914 he was appointed Director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Physical
        Institute and Professor in the University of Berlin. He became a German citizen in 1914 and
        remained in Berlin until 1933 when he renounced his citizenship for political reasons and
        emigrated to America to take the position of Professor of Theoretical Physics at Princeton*.
        He became a United States citizen in 1940 and retired from his post in 1945.

    <h1>Life and career</h1>
    <p>
        Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, on
        14 March 1879 into a family of secular Ashkenazi Jews. His parents were Hermann
        Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch. In 1880, the family moved to Munich,
        where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein &
        Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current.
        Albert attended a Catholic elementary school in Munich, from the age of five, for three
        years. At the age of eight, he was transferred to the Luitpold-Gymnasium (now known as
        the Albert-Einstein-Gymnasium), where he received advanced primary and secondary school
        education until he left the German Empire seven years later.

    <h1>Scientific career</h1>
    <p>Throughout his life, Einstein published hundreds of books and articles. He published more
        than 300 scientific papers and 150 non-scientific ones. On 5 December 2014,
        universities and archives announced the release of Einstein's papers, comprising more than
        30,000 unique documents. Einstein's intellectual achievements and originality have
        made the word "Einstein" synonymous with "genius". In addition to the work he did by
        himself he also collaborated with other scientists on additional projects including the
        Bose–Einstein statistics, the Einstein refrigerator and others.</p>

    <h1>Non-scientific legacy</h1>
    <p>While traveling, Einstein wrote daily to his wife Elsa and adopted stepdaughters Margot and
        Ilse. The letters were included in the papers bequeathed to the Hebrew University of
        Jerusalem. Margot Einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public,
        but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death (she died in 1986).
        Barbara Wolff, of the Hebrew University's Albert Einstein Archives, told the BBC that there
        are about 3,500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912 and 1955.</p>

    <p>Einstein's right of publicity was litigated in 2015 in a federal district court in California.
        Although the court initially held that the right had expired,that ruling was
        immediately appealed, and the decision was later vacated in its entirety.
        The underlying claims between the parties in that lawsuit were ultimately settled.
        The right is enforceable, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem is the exclusive
        representative of that right. Corbis, successor to The Roger Richman Agency,
        licenses the use of his name and associated imagery, as agent for the university.
        Mount Einstein in New Zealand's Paparoa Range was named after him in 1970 by the Department
        of Scientific and Industrial Research.</p>

    <h1>In popular culture</h1>
    <p>Einstein became one of the most famous scientific celebrities,beginning with
        the confirmation of his theory of general relativity in 1919.Despite the general
        public having little understanding of his work, he was widely recognized and received
        adulation and publicity. In the period before World War II, The New Yorker published a
        vignette in their "The Talk of the Town" feature saying that Einstein was so well known
        in America that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain "that
        theory". He finally figured out a way to handle the incessant inquiries. He told his
        inquirers, "Pardon me, sorry! Always I am mistaken for Professor Einstein.
        Einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels, films,
        plays, and works of music.[285] He is a favorite model for depictions of
        absent-minded professors; his expressive face and distinctive hairstyle have
        been widely copied and exaggerated. Time magazine's Frederic Golden wrote that
        Einstein was "a cartoonist's dream come true".
        Many popular quotations are often misattributed to him.</p>
